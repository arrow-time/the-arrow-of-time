abstract:This paper presents a discrete spacetime model where: (i) Time emerges as discrete entropy-increasing steps, with the universe evolving through state transitions of a Space Elementary Quantum (SEQ) network; entropy is calculated via multiplicative energy distributions across SEQ network.  (ii) SU(3) mediates local space compression through 3D modulation and axis transformations, maintaining spherical symmetry. This compression induces isotropic gravitational fields via external space stretching. (iii) The essence of mass is the storage of gravitational (spatial elastic) potential energy under the interaction of SU(3) corresponding to the compression of space. (iv)The framework provides a concrete mechanism for time dilation: local compression or stretching of SEQ modulates transformation frequency, directly linking gravitational/kinematic effects to observable time dilation phenomena. (v)The model predicts a falsifiable signature: a measurable difference between positron and electron magnetic moments, arising from their opposite chiral coupling to the fixed-spin SEQ ground state.
